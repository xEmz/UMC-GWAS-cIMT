Combined and sex-stratified genome-wide association meta-studies performed in a bash environment using  MetaGWASToolKit. Post-GWAS analysis is performed using clumping with PLINK and gene annotation with FUMA. 

Scripts used for meta-analysis can be found in the [MetaGWASToolKit](https://github.com/swvanderlaan/MetaGWASToolKit.git) repository. 
Scripts used for the miami plot and interaction-analysis are not included in MetaGWASToolKit and are found in this repository.
