# Analysis of sex differences in the genetic of carotid atherosclerosis

<br>
With a death rate of nearly 18 million people each year, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common cause of death worldwide. The central Diagnostic Laboratory of the University Medical Centre (UMC) in Utrecht conducts research into CVDs such as ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. An important phenotypic marker for the progression of carotid atherosclerosis is carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). Respective genetic association studies of cIMT have been conducted in global populations and have provided insight into the link between genetic effects and regulatory mechanisms of atherosclerosis. This has resulted in significant genetic correlations between cIMT and CVDs. Significant sex differences in the prevalence and severity of cIMT and carotid plaques have also been observed. Men statistically tend to have increased cIMT than women. Therefore, insight into sexual dimorphic effects on the development of atherosclerosis using genome-wide associationâ€“meta-studies (GWAMA) between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and cIMT is necessary for the development of sex-specific targets and biomarker development.</br>

<br>
However, limited well-powered data from multiple populations have been gathered about sex-specific effects on atherosclerosis. Men and women are generally analysed together in sex-combined genetic analyses, which estimate the homogeneity of the genetic effects in men and women. </br>
 
 <br>
In this research, data from multiple individual cohort studies with almost 60,000 men and women from different populations have been collected. Individual imputation and quality control had already been performed on the cohorts, and sample files containing both- and separated sexes had been generated. The multiple cohorts were cleaned, reformatted, and harmonized in a standardized way for meta-analysis. A sex-stratified analysis on separate male and female samples has been performed to test for sex-specific significant variants. Post-GWAS analysis has been performed to gain more insight into the significant variants and genes.</br>
